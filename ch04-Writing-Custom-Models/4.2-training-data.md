- Artificial Neural Networks

Artificial neural networks are loosely based on how we believe the brain is structured. Just as the brain looks at an object or an animalâ€™s features and then predicts what that object or animal is, an ML model is trained on features and calculates the probabilities for its predictions using mathematics instead of biology. When these artificial neurons are connected in multiple layers, they are called deep neural networks.


- Artificial Neurons and Perceptrons

The artificial neuron is the basic unit or element of a neural network. One type of artificial neuron is the perceptron. The perceptron is the basic building block of ML that takes in input data and transforms inputs into some output number if it crosses some threshold for activation.
